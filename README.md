# OPTIMIZING SALES AND CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT - MZALENDO COFFEE MARKETERS

## Overview
Sales Dashboard for a Coffee Marketing Company showing profitability across products, customer purchasing behavior and overall sales performance.

## Business Problem Statement
The company seeks to improve its sales and customer engagement strategy by developing an interactive Excel dashboard. This dashboard should provide stakeholders with insights into sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and product profitability. The goal is to identify trends, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance customer loyalty.

## Data Sources
I obtained the data from an Excel Tutorial Project by Mo Chen, a data analyst content creator. Here is the link to the tutorial as well as the dataset used for this analysis:

#### *Considerations*
I decided to give this project a twist by **attaching the dataset to a fictional company name and altering the numerical columns** for sales and profits from **USD to KES**. In the [Data Transformation](#data-transformation) section, I provide more insights on how I executed this. This analysis draws inspiration from the tutorial but I used my own unique approach to provide value to whoever would like to use the same dataset to learn.

## Tools
This project is purely Microsoft Excel based. I performed my data cleaning, data transformations, analysis and visualization using Microsoft Excel.
